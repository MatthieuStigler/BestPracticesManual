  Abstract                 = {Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) established that economic institutions today are correlated with expected mortality of European colonialists. David Albouy argues this relationship is not robust. He drops all data from Latin America and much of the data from Africa, making up almost 60 percent of our sample, despite much information on the mortality of Europeans in those places during the colonial period. He also includes a "campaign" dummy that is coded inconsistently; even modest corrections undermine his claims. We also show that limiting the effect of outliers strengthens our results, making them robust to even extreme versions of Albouy's critiques.},

However, 36 of the 64 countries in the sample are assigned mortality rates from other countries, often based on mistaken or conflicting evidence. Also, incomparable mortality rates from populations of laborers, bishops, and soldiersoften on campaignare combined in a manner that favors the hypothesis. When these data issues are controlled for, the relationship between mortality and expropriation risk lacks robustness, and instrumental-variable estimates become unreliable, often with infinite confidence intervals.},

The pandemic arrived unexpectedly in the fall of 1918 and had largely subsided by January 1919, generating sharp predictions for long?term effects. Data from the 196080 decennial U.S. Census indicate that cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments compared with other birth cohorts. These results indicate that investments in fetal health can increase human capital.},

Replication of published results is recognized as an essential part of the scientific method. Yet, historically, both the demand for and supply of replicable results in economics has been minimal. Respect for the scientific method is not sufficient to motivate either economists or editors of professional journals to ensure the replicability of published results. We enumerate the costs and benefits of mandatory data and code archives, and argue that the benefits far exceed the costs. Progress has been made since the gloomy assessment of Dewald, Thursby and Anderson some 20 years ago in the American Economic Review, but much remains to be done before empirical economics ceases to be a dismal science when judged by the replicability of its published results.},

Using a hand-collected data set describing the data-sharing behaviour of 488 randomly selected empirical researchers, we provide evidence that most researchers in economics and management do not share their data voluntarily. We derive testable hypotheses based on the theoretical literature on information-sharing and relate data-sharing to observable characteristics of researchers. We find empirical support for the hypotheses that voluntary data-sharing significantly increases with (a) academic tenure, (b) the quality of researchers, (c) the share of published articles subject to a mandatory data-disclosure policy of journals, and (d) personal attitudes towards open science? principles. On the basis of our empirical evidence, we discuss a set of policy recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {This study is a response to Klein et al. (2008), which was highly critical of earlier work by Ashton et al. (2003). This work considering the link between international soccer results and stock market returns was challenged by Klein et al. (2008), who reject the presence and importance of this link. In response, this work provides a reassessment of the link between international soccer results and stock market returns within Ashton et al. (2003). This new analysis extends the original work by using a larger dataset, employing an extended range of tests and allowing for outliers. It is reported that, contrary to the findings of Klein et al. (2008), the link between international soccer results and stock market prices does indeed exist particularly within the sample period 19842002 used by Ashton et al. (2003). After extending the dataset to include observations from 2002 until 2009, it is reported that the effect on stock market returns has declined in importance over this period, particularly the impact of wins.},

  Abstract                 = {Significance tests were originally developed to enable more objective evaluations of research results. Yet the strong orientation towards statistical significance encourages biased results, a phenomenon termed publication bias?. Publication bias occurs whenever the likelihood or time-lag of publication, or the prominence, language, impact factor of journal space or the citation rate of studies depend on the direction and significance of research findings. Although there is much evidence concerning the existence of publication bias in all scientific disciplines and although its detrimental consequences for the progress of the sciences have been known for a long time, all attempts to eliminate the bias have failed. The present article reviews the history and logic of significance testing, the state of research on publication bias, and existing practical recommendations. After demonstrating that more systematical research on the risk factors of publication bias is needed, the paper suggests two new directions for publication bias research. First, a more comprehensive theoretical model based on theories of rational choice and economics as well as on the sociology of science is sketched out. Publication bias is recognized as the outcome of a social dilemma that cannot be overcome by moral pleas alone. Second, detection methods for publication bias going beyond meta-analysis, ones that are more suitable for testing causal hypotheses, are discussed. In particular, the caliper test? seems well-suited for conducting theoretically motivated comparisons across heterogeneous research fields like sociology. Its potential is demonstrated by testing hypotheses on (a) the relevance of explicitly vs. implicitly stated research propositions and on (b) the relevance of the number of authors on incidence rates of publication bias in 50 papers published in leading German sociology journals.},

  Abstract                 = {Journals favor rejections of the null hypothesis. This selection upon results may distort the behavior of researchers. Using 50,000 tests published between 2005 and 2011 in the {AER}, {JPE} and {QJE}, we identify a residual in the distribution of tests that cannot be explained by selection. The distribution of p-values exhibits a camel shape with abundant p-values above .25, a valley between .25 and .10 and a bump slightly under .05. Missing tests are those which would have been accepted but close to being rejected (p-values between .25 and .10). We show that this pattern corresponds to a shift in the distribution of p-values: between 10\% and 20\% of marginally rejected tests are misallocated. Our interpretation is that researchers might be tempted to inflate the value of their tests by choosing the specification that provides the highest statistics. Note that Inflation is larger in articles where stars are used in order to highlight statistical significance and lower in articles with theoretical models.},

  Abstract                 = {Douglas Almond's use of the 1918 U.S. in uenza pandemic as a
natural experiment led to the seminal works on the subject of in utero
health's impact on later life outcomes. The identication strength and
clarity of his work, though, is driven by the inherent natural experi-
ment supposition of random assignment. By using data from the 1920
and 1930 U.S. census, this study investigates this keystone assump-
tion and shows that the families of the {\textbackslash}treatment" cohort used by
Douglas Almond were signicantly less literate and economically pros-
perous than the families of the {\textbackslash}control" group. The rst order eect
of parent's education and wealth on a child's long-run {SES} and health
conditions eliminates Almond's ability to make direct inference on fe
tal health's impact on one's long-term wellbeing using the 1918 U.S.
in uenza pandemic.},

However, for very persistent outcome variables, and in smaller samples, pair-wise matching and stratification perform best and appear to dominate the rerandomization methods commonly used in practice. The simulations also point to specific recommendations for which variables to balance on, and for which controls to include in the ex post analysis.},

Good policies are ones that are themselves important for growth. The quality of policy has only a small impact on the allocation of aid.

To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after the rise. Comparisons of employment growth at stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage was constant) provide simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. We also compare employment changes at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (above \$5) to the changes at lower-wage stores. We find no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.},

Some researchers are optimistic that many published findings will be replicated. But others are concerned that if the project confirms few studies, it could unfairly indict psychology.

  Abstract                 = {Despite their importance, there is limited evidence on how institutions can be strengthened. Evaluating the effects of specific reforms is complicated by the lack of exogenous variation in institutions, the difficulty of measuring institutional performance, and the temptation to cherry pick? estimates from among the large number of indicators required to capture this multifaceted subject. We evaluate one attempt to make local institutions more democratic and egalitarian by imposing participation requirements for marginalized groups (including women) and test for learning-by-doing effects. We exploit the random assignment of a governance program in Sierra Leone, develop innovative real-world outcome measures, and use a preanalysis plan ({PAP}) to bind our hands against data mining. The intervention studied is a community-driven development? program, which has become a popular strategy for foreign aid donors. We find positive short-run effects on local public goods and economic outcomes, but no evidence for sustained impacts on collective action, decision making, or the involvement of marginalized groups, suggesting that the intervention did not durably reshape local institutions. We discuss the practical trade-offs faced in implementing a {PAP} and show how in its absence we could have generated two divergent, equally erroneous interpretations of program impacts on institutions. {JEL} Codes: F35, H41, O4},

  Abstract                 = {ContextSelective reporting of outcomes within published studies based on the
nature or direction of their results has been widely suspected, but direct
evidence of such bias is currently limited to case reports.ObjectiveTo study empirically the extent and nature of outcome reporting bias
in a cohort of randomized trials.DesignCohort study using protocols and published reports of randomized trials
approved by the Scientific-Ethical Committees for Copenhagen and Frederiksberg,
Denmark, in 1994-1995. The number and characteristics of reported and unreported
trial outcomes were recorded from protocols, journal articles, and a survey
of trialists. An outcome was considered incompletely reported if insufficient
data were presented in the published articles for meta-analysis. Odds ratios
relating the completeness of outcome reporting to statistical significance
were calculated for each trial and then pooled to provide an overall estimate
of bias. Protocols and published articles were also compared to identify discrepancies
in primary outcomes.Main Outcome MeasuresCompleteness of reporting of efficacy and harm outcomes and of statistically
significant vs nonsignificant outcomes; consistency between primary outcomes
defined in the most recent protocols and those defined in published articles.ResultsOne hundred two trials with 122 published journal articles and 3736
outcomes were identified. Overall, 50\% of efficacy and 65\% of harm outcomes
per trial were incompletely reported. Statistically significant outcomes had
a higher odds of being fully reported compared with nonsignificant outcomes
for both efficacy (pooled odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.4-4.0)
and harm (pooled odds ratio, 4.7; 95\% {CI}, 1.8-12.0) data. In comparing published
articles with protocols, 62\% of trials had at least 1 primary outcome that
was changed, introduced, or omitted. Eighty-six percent of survey responders
(42/49) denied the existence of unreported outcomes despite clear evidence
to the contrary.ConclusionsThe reporting of trial outcomes is not only frequently incomplete but
also biased and inconsistent with protocols. Published articles, as well as
reviews that incorporate them, may therefore be unreliable and overestimate
the benefits of an intervention. To ensure transparency, planned trials should
be registered and protocols should be made publicly available prior to trial
completion.},

I show that this finding is driven by a (counterintuitive) positive correlation between conflict in t and rainfall levels in t 2. If lower rainfall levels or negative rainfall shocks increased conflict, {MSS}'s finding should have been due to a negative correlation between conflict in t and rainfall levels in t 1.

Without a trial registry, the possibilities for data mining, created by analyses of multiple outcomes and subgroups, undermine internal validity.

The vast majority of health-related observational studies are not prospectively registered and the advantages of registration have not been fully appreciated. Nonetheless, international standards require approval of study protocols by an independent ethics committee before the study can begin. We suggest that there is an ethical and scientific imperative to publicly preregister key information from newly approved protocols, which should be required by funders. Ultimately, more complete information may be publicly available by disclosing protocols, analysis plans, data sets, and raw data.},

We consider three explanations for this finding: that all null hypotheses are mere approximations, that data-mining biases reported standard errors downward, and that journals tend to publish papers that fail to reject their null hypotheses only when the null hypotheses are likely to be false. While all these explanations are important, the last seems best able to explain our findings.},

Joyce (2003) examines crime committed in the period 1985-90 for the cohorts born immediately before and after abortion legalization. He finds little impact of legalized abortion. In this paper, we demonstrate that Joyce's failure to uncover a negative relationship between abortion and crime is a consequence of his decision to focus almost exclusively on one nonrepresentative six-year period during the peak of the crack epidemic. We provide empirical evidence that the crack-cocaine epidemic hit the high-abortion early-legalizing states earlier and more severely than other states. When we simply replicate his analyses, but extend the sample to cover the entire lives of these exact same cohorts, abortion is just as negatively related to crime as in our original analysis. Joyce's results appear to be purely an artifact of omitted variable bias due to focusing on the peak crack years without including adequate controls for crack.},

States with high abortion rates in the 1970s and 1980s experienced greater crime reductions in the 1990s. In high abortion states, only arrests of those born after abortion legalization fall relative to low abortion states. Legalized abortion appears to account for as much as 50 percent of the recent drop in crime.},

Using a more carefully constructed measure of abortion that better links birth cohorts to abortion exposure (by using abortion data by state of residence rather than of occurrence, by adjusting for cross-state mobility, and by more precisely estimating birth years from age of arrest data), we present new evidence that abortion legalization reduces crime through both a cohort-size and a selection effect.},

When all the available estimates are combined and averaged, there seems to be evidence of a genuine and positive economic freedom economic growth effect. However, it is also shown that the economic freedom economic growth literature is tainted strongly with publication bias. The existence of publication bias makes it difficult to identify the magnitude of the genuine effect of economic freedom on economic growth. The paper explores the differences between aggregate and disaggregate measures of economic freedom and shows that selection effects are stronger when aggregate measures are used.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract..There is growing concern and mounting evidence of selectivity in empirical economics. Most empirical economic literatures have a truncated distribution of results. The aim of this paper is to explore the link between publication selectivity and theory contests. This link is confirmed through the analysis of 87 distinct empirical economics literatures, involving more than three and a half thousand separate empirical studies, using objective measures of both selectivity and contests. Our metameta-analysis shows that publication selection is widespread, but not universal. It distorts scientific inference with potentially adverse effects on policy making, but competition and debate between rival theories reduces this selectivity and thereby improves economic inference.},

I exploit a unique data set to reliably estimate annual rates of gun ownership at both the state and the county levels during the past two decades. My findings demonstrate that changes in gun ownership are significantly positively related to changes in the homicide rate, with this relationship driven almost entirely by an impact of gun ownership on murders in which a gun is used. The effect of gun ownership on all other crime categories is much less marked. Recent reductions in the fraction of households owning a gun can explain one?third of the differential decline in gun homicides relative to nongun homicides since 1993.},

Chemin applied propensity score matching to the Pitt and Khandker data, finding different impacts, but does not disaggregate by gender of borrower. We first replicate Chemin and extend his analysis in two ways. We test the robustness of propensity score matching results to selection on unobservables using sensitivity analysis, and we investigate propensity score matching estimates of impacts by gender of borrowers. The mainly insignificant impacts of microfinance differ greatly by gender of borrower, but are all vulnerable to selection on unobservables. We are therefore not convinced that the relationships between microfinance and outcomes are causal with these data.},

Chemin (2008) made at least one crucial undocumented and unrealistic assumption, and did not document many of his variable constructions. {MP} correctly identifies inappropriate members of control groups, and other problems, but his claim that his propensity score matching ({PSM}) results provide support for Pitt and Khandker's (1998 {PnK}) most important claim is misleading as it is not robust. We see no reason to change our conclusion that {PnK} is limited as an evaluation of microfinance by a weak research design which cannot be convincingly mitigated by the sophisticated methods used in {PnK}, or by {PSM}.},

  Abstract                 = {High sex ratios in China and India have historically concerned researchers (Sen 1990) and their recent increase has alarmed policymakers worldwide. This paper identifies sex selection via infanticide and abortion as the principal explanation for the sex ratio distortion, and rules out competing explanations such as biology (Oster 2005) or differential mortality rates. Consistent with recent work (Jha et al. 2006), I find that the sex ratio of first-order births is close to the natural rate and steeply rising following the birth of low-order daughters, indicating that mothers are practicing pre-natal sex selection or immediate infanticide. Sex ratios are found to be higher among those anticipating lower fertility, such as those under stricter government fertility limits. I present a model of a mother's fertility choice when she has access to a sex-selection technology and faces a mandated fertility limit. By exploiting variation in fines levied in China for unsanctioned births, I demonstrate that higher fine regimes discourage fertility but are associated with higher sex ratios among those who choose to have an additional child. I then estimate a structural model of parental preferences using China's 2000 census data that indicates that a son is worth 2.90 years of income more than a daughter, and the premium is highest among less educated mothers and rural families. I conclude with a set of simulations to model the effect on sex ratios and total fertility of a proposed subsidy to families who fail to have a son, and find that such a policy would reduce sex ratios and lower overall fertility.},

  Abstract                 = {Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ({STROBE}) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, casecontrol and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of {STROBE} contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the {STROBE} Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, casecontrol, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of {PLoS} Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine and Epidemiology. We hope that the {STROBE} Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have "tested" a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22\% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.},

This lottery provides an opportunity to gauge the effects of expanding access to public health insurance on the health care use, financial strain, and health of low-income adults using a randomized controlled design. In the year after random assignment, the treatment group selected by the lottery was about 25 percentage points more likely to have insurance than the control group that was not selected. We find that in this first year, the treatment group had substantively and statistically significantly higher health care utilization (including primary and preventive care as well as hospitalizations), lower out-of-pocket medical expenditures and medical debt (including fewer bills sent to collection), and better self-reported physical and mental health than the control group. {JEL} Codes: H51, H75, I1.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied publication bias in the social sciences by analyzing a known population of conducted studies221 in totalin which there is a full accounting of what is published and unpublished. We leveraged Time-sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences ({TESS}), a National Science Foundationsponsored program in which researchers propose survey-based experiments to be run on representative samples of American adults. Because {TESS} proposals undergo rigorous peer review, the studies in the sample all exceed a substantial quality threshold. Strong results are 40 percentage points more likely to be published than are null results and 60 percentage points more likely to be written up. We provide direct evidence of publication bias and identify the stage of research production at which publication bias occurs: Authors do not write up and submit null findings.
The file drawer is full. Should we worry?
Experiments that produce null results face a higher barrier to publication than those that yield statistically significant differences. Whether this is a problem depends on how many null but otherwise valid results might be trapped in the file drawer. Franco et al. use a Time-sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences archive of nearly 250 peer-reviewed proposals of social science experiments conducted on nationally representative samples. They find that only 10 out of 48 null results were published, whereas 56 out of 91 studies with strongly significant results made it into a journal.

  Abstract                 = {In 1984 the Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics ({QJBE}) became the first journal to give priority to publishing econometric replications. This study is a retrospective on the research published in the {QJBE} under this policy. Over the 1984-1994 period replications occupied more than 21 percent of the journal's contents. Further, the acceptance rate for replications has been higher than for other studies. The journal also devoted more than 5 percent of its pages to reviews of empirical literature. Replication articles have focused on financial economics and industrial organization; they tend to use publicly available data sets and not to contradict entirely the findings of earlier studies. Econometric replications have been more heavily represented in the {QJBE} than in other outlets, but they have not dominated the contents of the journal. This finding suggests that editorial policy can bring forth a supply of replication research, but other active measures are necessary before such studies become more common.},

Prospective impact evaluations should be used selectively to assess whether or not a program has achieved its intended results, or to test alternatives for achieving those results. We consider that more and better impact evaluation will help strengthen the evidence base for development policies and programs around the world. If governments and development practitioners can make policy decisions based on evidence - including evidence generated through impact evaluation - our hope is that development resources will be spent more effectively, and ultimately have a greater impact on reducing poverty and improving people's lives. The three chapters in this handbook provide a non-technical introduction to impact evaluations, including Why Evaluate? in Chapter 1, How to Evaluate? in Chapter 2 and How to Implement Impact Evaluations? in Chapter 3. These elements are the basic 'tools' needed in order to successfully carry out an impact evaluation. From a methodological standpoint our approach to impact evaluation is largely pragmatic: we think that the most appropriate methods should be identified to fit the operational context, and not the other way around. This is best achieved at the outset of the program, through the design of prospective impact evaluation that can be built into the project's implementation. We argue that gaining consensus between key stakeholders and identifying an evaluation design that fits the political and operational context is as important as the method itself. We also believe strongly that impact evaluations should be upfront about their limitations and caveats. Finally, we strongly encourage policymakers and program managers to consider impact evaluations in a logical framework that clearly sets out the causal pathways by which the program works to produce outputs and influence final outcomes, and to combine impact evaluations with monitoring and selected complementary evaluation approach to gain a full picture of performance.This book builds on a core set of teaching materials developed for the Turning Promises to Evidence? workshops organized by the office of the Chief Economist for Human Development ({HDNCE}) in partnership with regional units and the Development Economics Research Group ({DECRG}) at the World Bank.},

Drawing on the experience of researchers at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, which has run hundreds of such evaluations in dozens of countries throughout the world, it offers practical insights on how to use this powerful technique, especially in resource-poor environments. This step-by-step guide explains why and when randomized evaluations are useful, in what situations they should be used, and how to prioritize different evaluation opportunities. It shows how to design and analyze studies that answer important questions while respecting the constraints of those working on and benefiting from the program being evaluated. The book gives concrete tips on issues such as improving the quality of a study despite tight budget constraints, and demonstrates how the results of randomized impact evaluations can inform policy. With its self-contained modules, this one-of-a-kind guide is easy to navigate. It also includes invaluable references and a checklist of the common pitfalls to avoid.

A widely disseminated paper by Emily Oster argues that a large part of this phenomenon can be attributed to excessively masculine sex ratios at birth resulting from maternal infection with hepatitis B. If her thesis is true, current policies to address this problem would need to be reframed to include biological factors in addition to cultural factors. The data show, however, that whether or not females go missing? is determined by the existing sex composition of the family into which they are conceived. Girls with no older sisters have similar chances of survival as boys. However, girls conceived in families that already have a daughter experience steeply higher probabilities of being aborted or of dying in early childhood. This indicates that cultural factors still provide the overwhelming explanation for the missing? females.},

A subsample was independently verified.Data Synthesis: Of 110 trials with results, most were industry-sponsored, parallel-design drug studies. The most common inconsistency was the number of secondary outcome measures reported (80\%). Sixteen trials (15\%) reported the primary outcome description inconsistently, and 22 (20\%) reported the primary outcome value inconsistently. Thirty-eight trials inconsistently reported the number of individuals with a serious adverse event ({SAE}); of these, 33 (87\%) reported more {SAEs} in {ClinicalTrials}.gov. Among the 84 trials that reported {SAEs} in {ClinicalTrials}.gov, 11 publications did not mention {SAEs}, 5 reported them as zero or not occurring, and 21 reported a different number of {SAEs}. Among 29 trials that reported deaths in {ClinicalTrials}.gov, 28\% differed from the matched publication.Limitation: Small sample that included earliest results posted to the database.Conclusion: Reporting discrepancies between the {ClinicalTrials}.gov results database and matching publications are common.

Given this extensive data mining, it does not make any economic or statistical sense to use the usual significance criteria for a newly discovered factor, e.g., a t-ratio greater than 2.0. However, what hurdle should be used for current research? Our paper introduces a multiple testing framework and provides a time series of historical significance cutoffs from the first empirical tests in 1967 to today. Our new method allows for correlation among the tests as well as publication bias. We also project forward 20 years assuming the rate of factor production remains similar to the experience of the last few years. The estimation of our model suggests that today a newly discovered factor needs to clear a much higher hurdle, with a t-ratio greater than 3.0. Echoing a recent disturbing conclusion in the medical literature, we argue that most claimed research findings in financial economics are likely false. Our key results are summarized:},

We find that the effect of shall-issue laws on crime is much less well-estimated than the Mustard and Lott (1997) and Lott (2000) results suggest. We also find, however, that the cross equation restrictions implied by the Lott-Mustard theory are supported. A boomlet has occurred in recent years in the use of quasi-natural experiments to answer important questions of public policy. The intuitive power of this approach, however, has sometimes diverted attention from the statistical assumptions that must be made, particularly regarding standard errors. Failing to take into account serial correlation and grouped data can dramatically reduce standard errors suggesting greater certainty in effects than is actually the case.

  Abstract                 = {We replicate Reinhart and Rogoff (2010A and 2010B) and find that selective exclusion of available data, coding errors and inappropriate weighting of summary statistics lead to serious miscalculations that inaccurately represent the relationship between public debt and {GDP} growth among 20 advanced economies. Over 19462009, countries with public debt/{GDP} ratios above 90\% averaged 2.2\% real annual {GDP} growth, not 0.1\% as published. The published results for (i) median {GDP} growth rates for the 19462009 period and (ii) mean and median {GDP} growth figures over 17902009 are all distorted by similar methodological errors, although the magnitudes of the distortions are somewhat smaller than with the mean figures for 19462009. Contrary to Reinhart and Rogoffs broader contentions, both mean and median {GDP} growth when public debt levels exceed 90\% of {GDP} are not dramatically different from when the public debt/{GDP} ratios are lower. The relationship between public debt and {GDP} growth varies significantly by period and country. Our overall evidence refutes {RR}s claim that public debt/{GDP} ratios above 90\% consistently reduce a countrys {GDP} growth.},

My results suggest that metropolitan areas with greater Tiebout choice have more productive public schools and less private schooling. Little of the effect of Tiebout choice works through its effect on household sorting. This finding may be explained by another finding: students are equally segregated by school in metropolitan areas with greater and lesser degrees of Tiebout choice among districts.},

  Abstract                 = {Social scientists generally enjoy substantial latitude in selecting measures and models for hypothesis testing. Coupled with publication and related biases, this latitude raises the concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally select models that yield positive findings, leading to an unreliable body of published research. To combat this fishing? problem in medical studies, leading journals now require preregistration of designs that emphasize the prior identification of dependent and independent variables. However, we demonstrate here that even with this level of advanced specification, the scope for fishing is considerable when there is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing field experiment for which we drafted a complete mock report? of findings using fake data on treatment assignment. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of this form of registration and propose that a comprehensive but nonbinding approach be adopted as a first step to combat fishing by social scientists. Likely effects of comprehensive but nonbinding registration are discussed, the principal advantage being communication rather than commitment, in particular that it generates a clear distinction between exploratory analyses and genuine tests.},

There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user friendly manner. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards ({CHEERS}) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines efforts into one current, useful reporting guidance. The primary audiences for the {CHEERS} statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The recommendations are contained in a user friendly, 24 item checklist. A copy of the statement, accompanying checklist, and this report can be found on the {ISPOR} Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force website: (www.ispor.org/{TaskForces}/{EconomicPubGuidelines}.asp). We hope {CHEERS} will lead to better reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the {CHEERS} statement is being co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups, to endorse {CHEERS}. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in five years.},

  Abstract                 = {Antidepressants, in particular newer agents, are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide with annual sales of billions of dollars. The introduction of these agents in the market has passed through seemingly strict regulatory control. Over a thousand randomized trials have been conducted with antidepressants. Statistically significant benefits have been repeatedly demonstrated and the medical literature is flooded with several hundreds of "positive" trials (both pre-approval and post-approval). However, two recent meta-analyses question this picture. The first meta-analysis used data that were submitted to {FDA} for the approval of 12 antidepressant drugs. While only half of these trials had formally significant effectiveness, published reports almost ubiquitously claimed significant results. "Negative" trials were either left unpublished or were distorted to present "positive" results. The average benefit of these drugs based on the {FDA} data was of small magnitude, while the published literature suggested larger benefits. A second meta-analysis using also {FDA}-submitted data examined the relationship between treatment effect and baseline severity of depression. Drug-placebo differences increased with increasing baseline severity and the difference became large enough to be clinically important only in the very small minority of patient populations with severe major depression. In severe major depression, antidepressants did not become more effective, simply placebo lost effectiveness. These data suggest that antidepressants may be less effective than their wide marketing suggests. Short-term benefits are small and long-term balance of benefits and harms is understudied. I discuss how the use of many small randomized trials with clinically non-relevant outcomes, improper interpretation of statistical significance, manipulated study design, biased selection of study populations, short follow-up, and selective and distorted reporting of results has built and nourished a seemingly evidence-based myth on antidepressant effectiveness and how higher evidence standards, with very large long-term trials and careful prospective meta-analyses of individual-level data may reach closer to the truth and clinically useful evidence.

  Abstract                 = {17 187 patients entering 417 hospitals up to 24 hours (median 5 hours) after the onset of suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomised, with placebo control, between: (i) a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 15 {MU} of streptokinase; (ii) one month of 160 mg/day enteric-coated aspirin; (iii) both active treatments; or (iv) neither. Streptokinase alone and aspirin alone each produced a highly significant reduction in 5-week vascular mortality: 791/8592 (92\%) among patients allocated streptokinase infusion vs 1029/8595 (120\%) among those allocated placebo infusion (odds reduction: 25\% {SD} 4; 2p\&lt;000001); 804/8587 (94\%) vascular deaths among patients allocated aspirin tablets vs 1016/8600 (118\%) among those allocated placebo tablets (odds reduction: 23\% {SD} 4; 2p \&lt;000001). The combination of streptokinase and aspirin was significantly (2p\&lt;00001) better than either agent alone. Their separate effects on vascular deaths appeared to be additive: 343/4292 (80\%) among patients allocated both active agents vs 568/4300 (132\%) among those allocated neither (odds reduction: 42\% {SD} 5; 95\% confidence limits 34-50\%). There was evidence of benefit from each agent even for patients treated late after pain onset (odds reductions at 0-4, 5-12, and 13-24 hours: 35\% {SD} 6, 16\% {SD} 7, and 21\% {SD} 12 for streptokinase alone; 25\% {SD} 7, 21\% {SD} 7, and 21\% {SD} 12 for aspirin alone; and 53\% {SD} 8, 32\% {SD} 9, and 38\% {SD} 15 for the combination of streptokinase and aspirin). Streptokinase was associated with an excess of bleeds requiring transfusion (05\% vs 02\%) and of confirmed cerebral haemorrhage (01\% vs 00\%), but with fewer other strokes (06\% vs 08\%). These "other" strokes may have included a few undiagnosed cerebral haemorrhages, but still there was no increase in total strokes (07\% streptokinase vs 08\% placebo infusion). Aspirin significantly reduced non-fatal reinfarction (10\% vs 20\%) and non-fatal stroke (03\% vs 06\%), and was not associated with any significant increase in cerebral haemorrhage or in bleeds requiring transfusion. An excess of non-fatal reinfarction was reported when streptokinase was used alone, but this appeared to be entirely avoided by the addition of aspirin. Those allocated the combination of streptokinase and aspirin had significantly fewer deaths (80\% vs 132\%) than those allocated neither. The differences in vascular and in all-cause mortality produced by streptokinase and by aspirin remain highly significant (2p\&lt;0001 for each) after the median of 15 months of follow-up thus far available.},

If those states without right?to?carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, county? and state?level data indicate that approximately 1,500 murders would have been avoided yearly. Similarly, we predict that rapes would have declined by over 4,000, robbery by over 11,000, and aggravated assaults by over 60,000. We also find criminals substituting into property crimes involving stealth, where the probability of contact between the criminal and the victim is minimal. Further, higher arrest and conviction rates consistently reduce crime. The estimated annual gain from all remaining states adopting these laws was at least \$5.74 billion in 1992. The annual social benefit from an additional concealed handgun permit is as high as \$5,000.},

I find little consistent evidence that the legalization of abortion in selected states around 1970, and then in the remaining states following Roe v. Wade, had an effect on recent crime rates. I conclude that the dramatic association as reported in a recent study is most likely the result of unmeasured period effects such as changes in crack cocaine use.},

Very recent publications have, however, even found evidence that stock markets react to the results of soccer matches. In this article, we argue that such empirical studies should be analysed carefully; we thus endorse the use of replication studies to verify results. Consequently, by rebuilding the study of Ashton et al. (2003), we are able to detect mistakes in the empirical set-up. Based on these findings, we demonstrate how even minor flaws can have a crucial influence on the results of such studies and point out pitfalls that are frequently encountered. We furthermore emphasize the importance of robustness checks to validate the results of empirical studies.},

Computer programmers already know both kinds of languages; they need only learn a few conventions about alternating between languages to create programs that are works of literature. A literate programmer is an essayist who writes programs for humans to understand, instead of primarily writing instructions for machines to follow. When programs are written in the recommended style they can be transformed into documents by a document compiler and into efficient code by an algebraic compiler. This anthology of essays from the inventor of literate programming includes Knuth's early papers on related topics such as structured programming, as well as the Computer Journal article that launched literate programming itself.},

We argue that the emergence of new tools, particularly in the open-source community, have greatly eased the burden of documenting and archiving both empirical and simulation work in econometrics.

  Abstract                 = {Although replications are vital to scientific progress, psychologists rarely engage in systematic replication efforts. In this article, we consider psychologists narrative approach to scientific publications as an underlying reason for this neglect and propose an incentive structure for replications within psychology. First, researchers need accessible outlets for publishing replications. To accomplish this, psychology journals could publish replication reports in files that are electronically linked to reports of the original research. Second, replications should get cited. This can be achieved by cociting replications along with original research reports. Third, replications should become a valued collaborative effort. This can be realized by incorporating replications in teaching programs and by stimulating adversarial collaborations. The proposed incentive structure for replications can be developed in a relatively simple and cost-effective manner. By promoting replications, this incentive structure may greatly enhance the dependability of psychologys knowledge base.},

Yet, the response to this policy has been overwhelming. The {ICMJE} promised to reevaluate the policy . . .},

Increases in police are shown to substantially reduce violent crime, but have a smaller impact on property crime.

  Abstract                 = {The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata, by J. Scott Long, is an essential productivity tool for data analysts. Long presents lessons gained from his experience and demonstrates how to design and implement efficient workflows for both one-person projects and team projects. After introducing workflows and explaining how a better workflow can make it easier to work with data, Long describes planning, organizing, and documenting your work. He then introduces how to write and debug Stata do-files and how to use local and global macros. After a discussion of conventions that greatly simplify data analysis the author covers cleaning, analyzing, and protecting data.},

This article finds that abortion increases the number of out-of-wedlock births. Using data that more directly links the criminal with age when the crime was committed, not age when arrested, and fixing the assumption in previous research that no abortions took place prior to the Roe v. Wade decision in the 45 states affected by that decision, we find consistent significant evidence that legalizing abortions increased murders by over 7\%. Linear estimates indicate that legalization increased total annual victimization costs by at least \$3.2 billion. ({JEL} K42, K14, J24)},

  Abstract                 = {ContextAs of 2005, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors required investigators to register their trials prior to participant enrollment as a precondition for publishing the trial's findings in member journals.ObjectiveTo assess the proportion of registered trials with results recently published in journals with high impact factors; to compare the primary outcomes specified in trial registries with those reported in the published articles; and to determine whether primary outcome reporting bias favored significant outcomes.Data Sources and Study Selection{MEDLINE} via {PubMed} was searched for reports of randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) in 3 medical areas (cardiology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology) indexed in 2008 in the 10 general medical journals and specialty journals with the highest impact factors.Data ExtractionFor each included article, we obtained the trial registration information using a standardized data extraction form.ResultsOf the 323 included trials, 147 (45.5\%) were adequately registered (ie, registered before the end of the trial, with the primary outcome clearly specified). Trial registration was lacking for 89 published reports (27.6\%), 45 trials (13.9\%) were registered after the completion of the study, 39 (12\%) were registered with no or an unclear description of the primary outcome, and 3 (0.9\%) were registered after the completion of the study and had an unclear description of the primary outcome. Among articles with trials adequately registered, 31\% (46 of 147) showed some evidence of discrepancies between the outcomes registered and the outcomes published. The influence of these discrepancies could be assessed in only half of them and in these statistically significant results were favored in 82.6\% (19 of 23).ConclusionComparison of the primary outcomes of {RCTs} registered with their subsequent publication indicated that selective outcome reporting is prevalent.},

To make the data and code available so that published results can be checked requires an archive. Top economics journals have been adopting mandatory data+code archives in the past few years. The movement toward mandatory data+code archives has yet to reach the open access journals. This is paradoxical; given their emphasis on making articles readily available, one would think that open access journals also would want to make data and code readily available. Open access economics journals should adopt mandatory data+code archives en masse. Doing so will give them a competitive advantage with respect to traditional economics journals.},

Antonio Ciccone (2011) argues that thanks to rainfall's mean-reverting nature, rainfall levels are preferable to annual changes. We make three points. First, {MSS}'s findings hold using rainfall levels as instruments. Second, Ciccone (2011) does not provide theoretical justification for preferring rainfall levels. Third, the first-stage relationship between rainfall and growth is weaker after 2000, suggesting that alternative instruments are needed when studying recent conflicts. We highlight the accumulating microeconomic evidence that adverse economic shocks lead to political violence.},

Growth is strongly negatively related to civil conflict: a negative growth shock of five percentage points increases the likelihood of conflict by one?half the following year. We attempt to rule out other channels through which rainfall may affect conflict. Surprisingly, the impact of growth shocks on conflict is not significantly different in richer, more democratic, or more ethnically diverse countries.},

improvement in the quality of reports of {RCTs}.Design and SettingComparative before-and-after evaluation in which reports of {RCTs} published
in 1994 (pre-{CONSORT}) were compared with {RCT} reports from the same journals
published in 1998 (post-{CONSORT}). We included 211 reports from {BMJ}, {JAMA}, and The Lancet (journals that
adopted {CONSORT}) as well as The New England Journal of Medicine (a journal that did not adopt {CONSORT} and was used as a comparator).Main Outcome MeasuresNumber of {CONSORT} items included in a report, frequency of unclear reporting
of allocation concealment, and overall trial quality score based on the Jadad
scale, a 5-point quality assessment instrument.ResultsCompared with 1994, the number of {CONSORT} checklist items in reports
of {RCTs} increased in all 4 journals in 1998, and this increase was statistically
significant for the 3 adopter journals (pre-{CONSORT}, 23.4; mean change, 3.7;
95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 2.1-5.3). The frequency of unclear reporting
of allocation concealment decreased for each of the 4 journals, and this change
was statistically significant for adopters (pre-{CONSORT}, 61\%; mean change, 22\%;
95\% {CI}, 38\% to 6\%). Similarly, 3 of the 4 journals showed an
improvement in the quality score for reports of {RCTs}, and this increase was
statistically significant for adopter journals overall (pre-{CONSORT}, 2.7;
mean change, 0.4; 95\% {CI}, 0.1-0.8).ConclusionUse of the {CONSORT} statement is associated with improvements in the

  Abstract                 = {This article makes the case for the systematic registration of political studies. By proposing a research design before an outcome variable is observed, a researcher commits him- or herself to a theoretically motivated method for studying the object of interest. Further, study registration prompts peers of the discipline to evaluate a studys quality on its own merits, reducing norms to accept significant results and reject null findings. To advance this idea, the Political Science Registered Studies Dataverse (http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/registration) has been created, in which scholars may create a permanent record of a research design before completing a study. This article also illustrates the method of registration through a study of the impact of the immigration issue in the 2010 election for the U.S. House of Representatives. Prior to the election, a design for this study was posted on the Society for Political Methodology website (http://polmeth.wustl.edu/{mediaDetail}.php?{docId}=1258). After the votes were counted, the study was completed in accord with the design. The treatment effect in this theoretically specified design was indiscernible, but a specification search could yield a significant result. Hence, this article illustrates the argument for study registration through a case in which the result could easily be manipulated.},

  Abstract                 = {The Committee to Improve Research Information and Data on Firearms, which produced this book, was charged with providing an assessment of the strengths and limitations of the existing research and data on gun violence. One theme evident throughout the report is the relative absence of credible data that are central to answering the most basic questions about the link between firearms and violence, such as the effects of firearms on violence and the impacts of various violence-control policies. The inadequacy of data on gun ownership and use is among the most critical barriers to better understanding gun violence. The committee recommends a research effort to determine whether or not these kinds of data can be accurately collected with minimal risk to legitimate privacy concerns. Further, the committee recommends that for research purposes appropriate access be given to data maintained by regulatory and law enforcement agencies, including the trace data maintained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; registration data maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State agencies; and firearms manufacturing and sales data. Further, there are difficult methodological issues regarding how various datasets might be used to address the complex causal issues of interest. The committee recommends that a methodological research program be established to address these problems. Regarding the focus of research on firearms and violence, the committee recommends further individual-level studies of the link between firearms and both lethal and nonlethal suicidal behavior. Other research recommendations pertain to deterrence and defense and interventions to reduce violence and suicide. Chapter references and tables and a subject index},

  Abstract                 = {An academic scientists professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motivegetting it rightcompetitive with the more tangible and concrete incentivegetting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.},

  Abstract                 = {This document describes the findings from the interim evaluation survey conducted between October and December 2007, after 15 to 18 months of Generasi implementation in 129 treatment sub districts. Since one full year's project cycle had been completed, authors refer to this survey as the one-year interim evaluation survey. A final evaluation survey is planned for October-December 2009, after the program will have been in operation for 27-30 months. The Generasi project is focused on 12 indicators of maternal and child health behavior and educational behavior. These indicators were chosen by the government of Indonesia to be as similar as possible to the conditions for the individual household conditional cash transfer program being piloted at the same time as Generasi. They are in the same spirit as the conditions used by conditional cash transfer programs in other countries, such as Progresa in Mexico. These 12 indicators respond to those seeking health and educational services that are within the direct control of villagers-such as the number of children who receive immunization, prenatal and postnatal care, and the number of children enrolled and attending school-rather than long-term outcomes, such as test scores or infant mortality. This study provides strong evidence that in this context, community incentives work and are more effective for focusing impacts on the poorest quintiles and increasing providers' efforts. The policy implications are that poverty programs may wish to experiment more with embedding incentives into their designs. The Generasi project is implemented by the government of Indonesia's Ministry of Home Affairs, and is funded in part with loans from the World Bank and grants from the Netherlands Embassy.},

  Abstract                 = {In many Asian countries the ratio of male to female population is higher than in the West: as high as 1.07 in China and India, and even higher in Pakistan. A number of authors (most notably Amartya Sen) have suggested that this imbalance reflects excess female mortality and have argued that as many as 100 million women are missing.? This paper proposes an explanation for some of the observed overrepresentation of men: the hepatitis B virus. I present new evidence, consistent with an existing scientific literature, that carriers of the hepatitis B virus have offspring sex ratios around 1.50 boys for each girl. This evidence includes both cross?country analyses and a natural experiment based on recent vaccination campaigns. Hepatitis B is common in many Asian countries, especially China, where some 1015 percent of the population is infected. Using data on prevalence of the virus by country and estimates of the effect of hepatitis on the sex ratio, I argue that hepatitis B can account for about 45 percent of the missing women?: around 75 percent in China, between 20 and 50 percent in Egypt and western Asia, and under 20 percent in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal.},

For the first five years that such a law is in effect, the total benefit from reduced crimes usually ranges between approximately \$2 billion and \$3 billion per year. Ayres and Donohue have simply misread their own results. Their own most general specification that breaks down the impact of the law on a year-by-year basis shows large crime-reducing benefits. Virtually none of their claims that their county-level hybrid model implies initial significant increases in crime are correct. Overall, the vast majority of their estimates-based on data up to 1997-actually demonstrate that right-to-carry laws produce substantial crime-reducing benefits. We show that their models also do an extremely poor job of predicting the changes in crime rates after 1997.},

Data sources ClinicalTrials.gov, searched on 19 January 2011, with cross referencing with Drugs@FDA to determine for which trials mandatory reporting was required within one year.Selection criteria Studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with US sites which completed between 1 January and 31 December 2009.Main outcome measure Proportion of trials for which results had been reported.Results The ClinicalTrials.gov registry contained 83 579 entries for interventional trials, of which 5642 were completed within the timescale of interest. We identified trials as falling within the mandatory reporting rules if they were covered by the FDAAA (trials of a drug, device, or biological agent, which have at least one US site, and are of phase II or later) and if they investigated a drug that already had approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Of these, 163/738 (22\%) had reported results within one year of completion of the trial compared with 76/727 (10\%) trials that were not subject to mandatory reporting (95\% confidence interval for the difference in proportions 7.8\% to 15.5\%; ?2 test, P=2.6{\texttimes}10-9). Later phase trials were more likely to report results (P=4.4{\texttimes}10-11), as were industry funded trials (P=2.2{\texttimes}10-16).Conclusion Most trials subject to mandatory reporting did not report results within a year of completion.FootnotesContributors: APP, MNH, and ARS designed the study.

  Abstract                 = {Starting with Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti (2004), a large literature has used rainfall variation as an instrument to study the impacts of income shocks on civil war and
conict. These studies argue that in agriculturally-dependent regions, negative rain shocks lower income levels, which in turn incites violence. This identifcation strategy
relies on the assumption that rainfall shocks affect conflict only through their impacts on
income. I evaluate this exclusion restriction by identifying districts that are downstream from dams in India. In downstream districts, income is much less sensitive to rainfall fluctuations. However, rain shocks remain equally strong predictors of riot incidence in these districts. These results suggest that rainfall affects rioting through a channel other than income and cast doubt on the conclusion that income shocks incite riots.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary
Subgroup analyses can pose serious multiplicity concerns. By testing enough subgroups, a false-positive result will probably emerge by chance alone. Investigators might undertake many analyses but only report the significant effects, distorting the medical literature. In general, we discourage subgroup analyses. However, if they are necessary, researchers should do statistical tests of interaction, rather than analyse every separate subgroup. Investigators cannot avoid interim analyses when data monitoring is indicated. However, repeatedly testing at every interim raises multiplicity concerns, and not accounting for multiplicity escalates the false-positive error. Statistical stopping methods must be used. The O'Brien-Fleming and Peto group sequential stopping methods are easily implemented and preserve the intended level and power. Both adopt stringent criteria (low nominal p values) during the interim analyses. Implementing a trial under these stopping rules resembles a conventional trial, with the exception that it can be terminated early should a treatment prove greatly superior. Investigators and readers, however, need to grasp that the estimated treatment effects are prone to exaggeration, a random high, with early stopping.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ( .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

We introduce p-curve as a way to answer this question. P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p-values for a set of studies (ps {\textless} .05). Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p-values only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. This review considers several meta-regression and graphical methods that can differentiate genuine empirical effect from publication bias. Publication selection exists when editors, reviewers, or researchers have a preference for statistically significant results. Because all areas of empirical research are susceptible to publication selection, any average or tally of significant/insignificant studies is likely to be biased and potentially misleading. Meta-regression analysis can see through the murk of random sampling error and selected misspecification bias to identify the underlying statistical structures that characterize genuine empirical effect. Meta-significance testing and precision-effect testing ({PET}) are offered as a means to identify empirical effect beyond publication bias and are applied to four areas of empirical economics research minimum wage effects, union-productivity effects, price elasticities, and tests of the natural rate hypothesis.},

This lottery created a rare opportunity to study the effects of Medicaid coverage by using a randomized controlled design. By using the randomization provided by the lottery and emergency-department records from Portland-area hospitals, we studied the emergency department use of about 25,000 lottery participants over about 18 months after the lottery. We found that Medicaid coverage significantly increases overall emergency use by 0.41 visits per person, or 40% relative to an average of 1.02 visits per person in the control group. We found increases in emergency-department visits across a broad range of types of visits, conditions, and subgroups, including increases in visits for conditions that may be most readily treatable in primary care settings.},

  Abstract                 = {Systematic research reviews have become essential in all empirical sciences. However, the validity of research syntheses is threatened by the fact that not all studies on a given topic can be summarized. Research reviews may suffer from missing data, and this is especially crucial in those cases where the selectivity of studies and their findings affects the summarized result. So-called publication bias is a type of missing data and a phenomenon that jeopardizes the validity of systematic or quantitative, as well as narrative, reviews. Publication bias exists if the preparation, submission or publication of research findings depend on characteristics of just these research results, e. g. their direction or statistical significance. This article describes methods to identify publication bias in the context of meta-analysis. It also reviews empirical studies on the prevalence of publication bias, especially in the social and economic sciences, where publication bias also seems to be prevalent. Several proposals to prevent publication bias are discussed.},

In addition, both data and code need to be licensed permissively enough so that others can reproduce the work without a substantial legal burden. Implementing Reproducible Research covers many of the elements necessary for conducting and distributing reproducible research. It explains how to accurately reproduce a scientific result. Divided into three parts, the book discusses the tools, practices, and dissemination platforms for ensuring reproducibility in computational science. It describes: Computational tools, such as Sweave, knitr, {VisTrails}, Sumatra, {CDE}, and the Declaratron system Open source practices, good programming practices, trends in open science, and the role of cloud computing in reproducible research Software and methodological platforms, including open source software packages, {RunMyCode} platform, and open access journals Each part presents contributions from leaders who have developed software and other products that have advanced the field.

  Abstract                 = {The cut-and-paste approach to writing statistical reports is not only tedious and laborious, but also can be harmful to scientific research, because it is inconvenient to reproduce the results. Dynamic Documents with R and knitr introduces a new approach via dynamic documents, i.e. integrating computing directly with reporting. A comprehensive guide to the R package knitr, the book covers examples, document editors, basic usage, detailed explanations of a wide range of options, tricks and solutions, extensions, and complete applications of this package. The book provides an overview of dynamic documents, introducing the idea of literate programming. It then explains the importance of dynamic documents to scientific research and its impact on reproducible research. Building on this, the author covers basic concepts, common text editors that support knitr, and the syntax for different document formats such as {LaTeX}, {HTML}, and Markdown before going on to discuss core functionality, how to control text and graphics output, caching mechanisms that can reduce computation time, and reuse of source code. He then explores advanced topics such as chunk hooks, integrating other languages such as Python and awk into one report in the knitr framework, and useful tricks that make it easier to write documents with knitr. Discussions of how to publish reports in a variety of formats, applications, and other tools complete the coverage. Suitable for both beginners and advanced users, this book shows you how to write reports in simple languages such as Markdown. The reports range from homework, projects, exams, books, blogs, and web pages to any documents related to statistical graphics, computing, and data analysis. While familiarity with {LaTeX} and {HTML} is helpful, the book requires no prior experience with advanced programs or languages. For beginners, the text provides enough features to get started on basic applications. For power users, the last several chapters enable an understanding of the extensibility of the knitr package.},
